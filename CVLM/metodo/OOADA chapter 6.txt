Traits of Successful Projects
    ■Existence of a strong architectural vision

        ■ They are constructed in well-defined layers of abstraction, each layer repre-
        senting a coherent abstraction, provided through a well-defined and con-
        trolled interface, and built on equally well-defined and controlled facilities
        at lower levels of abstraction.
        
        ■ There is a clear separation of concerns between the interface and implemen-
        tation of each layer, making it possible to change the implementation of a
        layer without violating the assumptions made by its clients.
        
        ■ The architecture is simple: Common behavior is achieved through common
        abstractions and common mechanisms.

    ■ Application of a well-managed iterative and incremental development
    lifecycle
